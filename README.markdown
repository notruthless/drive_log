# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is starting out as the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

With some changes to make it appropriate for my final project.
I will update the readme at some point once it's clear we're on track... :)
